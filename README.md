To access this game, you must be running a node server in the console (I'm sorry I couldn't find a way to make the game compatible with the browser without paying money and I'm not about that)

To do this, Download node from "nodejs.org" 

Once you do this, use the cd command in either command prompt (Windows) or the terminal (Mac) and when you get to the folder type "http-server" with no quotation

Once you do this, type the ip address it gives you into the browser and you should see "Index of / " and a list of files. Click the one titled "DragonTales" and have fun!
